                <p>This project took place at KSchool from November to May, the main objective of the master is the development of an app using an UX approach and learning by doing. Initially we were a team of five people but during the project a new team member joined us  who helped us a lot.</p>

        <div class="post_text_column">
                <h3>Knowing our users</h3>
                <p>We started developing some <b>proto personas</b> where we put our initial thoughts and a bunch of prejudgements about who were the ASOS customers. Then we did a quantitative approach to extract qualitative insights, so we launched a questionnaire. From a total of 233 responses these were our analysis from our target (age 16-25).</p>      
                <ul>
                        <li>Their average income is about 500-1000&#8364; a month.</li>
                        <li>51% are students, 28,57% of those are working.</li>
                        <li>Favourite Apps: WhatsApp e Instagram.</li>
                        <li>Price, easy buying and tendencies are the main values when they buy.</li>
                        <li>35% will buy if there were a promotion (not a big number as we were expecting).</li>
                </ul> 
                <p>From this questionnaire we detected some tendencies and found some possible interesting users to interview. For <b>interviews</b> the main objective was to know what makes them loyal to a company, if they knew ASOS and which were their consuming habits. We delivered a total of 8 interviews of 45 minutes each one and found a lot of qualitative information that can be consulted at the project document.</p>
                <p>We also did some empathy maps and then we put together the common insights to create a unique <b>empathy map of or our users.</b></p>
                <p>Once we had enough information to understand who ASOS users were, we developed some <b>personas.</b></p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="post_text_column">
                <h3>Knowing the bussines</h3>
                <p>Through the information obtained from interviews we knew the main competence were the Inditex group: Zara, Stradivarious and Berskha, Zalando and H&M; so we did a benchmark of their webs. One interest thing is that the only one with a chatbot at that time was Zalando. We also created a comparative table of technologies and services of Asos and their competence.</p>
                 <p>Then we analysed ASOS through a DAFO. Some insights were:</p>
                 <ul>
                 <li>Asos doesn't invest in common advertisement media.</li>
                        <li>Far culture from spanish culture.</li>
                        <li>Brexit could be a potential risk for their sales.</li>
                    </ul>   
                <P>After that we elaborated a trend map of the industry.There were a big tendencie in investing in personal assistant tech as chatbots or virtual fitting mirrors. Marketing was still influenced by influencers and instagrammers. The User demands more information from their product from an ethical, ecological and chemical perspective. There was big tendency in flagships stores and logistics which was modulated by robotics and new delivery options.</P>
               <p>We also did a safari investigation to know how Asos service were working.</p>

            <div class="post_text_column">
                <h3>How to choose the strategy</h3>
                    <p>Once we had our users and business insights we decided to approach some solution. To achieve this goal we did an insight map, a brainstorming and then an attractive effort matrix to choose the solution.</p>
                    <H3>Value proposal and making mistakes</H3>
                    <p>We decided to base our decisions entirely on user's needs, this was a big error; since we forgot the business side, after realising that we were wrong, we redefined it.  At this point we were still diverging about the solution, we knew the solution had to be social but we didn't know how to do it yet, so we proposed "ASOS World" as our main objective that would focus on engaging young people and making them feel exclusive.</p>
                <h3>Receiving a new team member</h3>
                    <p>Due to some facts a new person of other team joined us. She provided us a lot of new 
                        ideas and also helped us to redefine the project. When she came we introduced her to the
                         project and all the investigation we had done. She helped us to give more consistency to the overall project and brought renewed fresh air.</p>

                <h3>We were burnt out</h3>
                <p>The truth is we were thinking about creating a social network but
                        other professionals and even us didn't see it due
                        to it complexity. We were fighting against this recurring idea that
                        always appeared in every debate, as result we were lost and exhausted 
                       because each team member had an idea of what should be "ASOS World".</p>
                <h3>Finally the solution</h3>
                <p>One day, after one of our many debates, a professional of the sector gave us the key
                        "don't create another social network it requires time, a lot effort and luck ... 
                       use what is done." So once we had this secret revealed, we saw everything with a different perspective.
                        Why not letting the users use their social networks to promote ourselves in exchange of points than
                        could be used in our shop. We would expand the image of ASOS while increasing the average ticket.
                        We got it! </p>
                <h3>It's not a new APP, it's a redesign</h3>
                <p>Instead of developing a new app we were going to use what we got. We considered the ASOS app to have enough volume of users that we can approach easier than if we were developing a new app. So we made a redesign of ASOS app that include some new services complemented with <b>gamification.</b></p>

                 <h3>Asos points and membership</h3>
                <p>Gamification system would use points, called ASOS Points, and a membership system. You can consult in every moment how much points do you have, where they came from and exchange them for discounts.  As we wanted to have some kind of barrier that would help us to control the entry to new services of personal shopper to prevent possible collapse, we established three status of membership</p>
                <ul>
                <li><b>Basic</b> (You have acess to our personal assistant sofware, everyone is basic by default)</li>
                <li><b>Silver</b> (You have acess to our personal shopper services) </li>
                <li><b>Golden</b> (You have access tou our personal shopper services and free deliveries)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The status of your membership is defined by the points you have obtained in a period, for example if you have earnt 2500 points during the last three months this mean you would be silver and you could use our personal shopper service. Each time the period ends the points reset.</p>

                <h3>Overall look</h3>
                <p>First when I entered this master I had no idea how to face a project of this kind. Everything was so new and there were so much tecniques, tools and ways of doing that
                    I was overwhelmed. But at the end I feel like now I can face better this project again. Learning by doing is a great technique because you are forced from the very first day to 
                    learn and apply it in a practical way boosting you knowledge and also draining your energy, but once you learn how to do it by the hard way, it's easier.

                        <p>I have the feeling we should have focused on less features. I mean we proposed a lot of changes, each one with it's own idiosyncrasy, and a lot of new services which implied a lot of business questions, throught ths way we always get stucked in the bussines side with questions we couldn't answer because we had no data.
                        By leaving one or two features we could have spent more time making a more solid project.
